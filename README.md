# Firebase + Nest.js Demo

## Objetive:
An application to register clients and calculate their probable death date, also show statistics about them.

## Achievements:
- Nest.js as REST api manager running in Firebase Functions
- Cheap method to re-calculate Standard Deviation without reading all documents on Firestore
- Angular 8 responsive application using **Material Design for Bootstrap** components

---

## Environment Setup
```
npm i -g @angular/cli @nestjs/cli firebase-tools
```
### Start Firestore emulator
```
cd /api/functions
npm run firestore
```
### Projects:

- /api/functions
    ```
    npm run start
    npm run start:dev
    npm run test
    npm run test:watch
    npm run test:cov
    ```
- /app
    ```
    npm run start
    npm run test
    ```

## Deployment to Firebase
0. Create a Firebase project and 
 - set the Firestor DB url into `\api\functions\src\core\firestore.provider.ts`
 - set Firebase api url into `\app\src\environments\environment.prod.ts`

1. Create a Firebase service account in
    https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/{PROJECT_ID}/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk and download it to `\api\functions\src\assets\firebase.json`

2. Login into Firebase
    ```
    firebase login
    ```
2. in `\api\functions` execute 
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```
2. in `\app` execute 
    ```
    npm run deploy
    ```



## Recalculate *Standard Deviation* Method

Original formula found on `http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52820.html`

```csharp 
interface DbStats { n: number; m: number; s: number; }

public recalculateStandardDeviation(stats: DbStats, v: number): DbStats {

        // Recalculate standard deviation:  (idea from: `http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/52820.html`)

        // So from n, mu, and s, we can recover Sum[x] and Sum[x^2], which means we can compute s'.

        // n        = the population size (number of data points)
        // mu       = population mean
        // s        = standard deviation
        // Sum[x^2] = the sum of the squares of all data points
        // Sum[x]   = the sum of all data points

        const { n, m, s } = stats;
        const sum1 = n * m;
        const sum2 = n * (s * s + m * m);  // n(s^2 + mu^2) = Sum[x^2]

        // the standard deviation after adding a new value, v, would be:
        //             (n+1)*(v^2 + Sum[x^2]) - (v + Sum[x])^2
        //  s' = Sqrt[ --------------------------------------- ]
        //                      (n+1)^2

        const n1 = n + 1;
        const m1 = (sum1 + v) / n1;
        const s1 = Math.sqrt(((n1) * (v * v + sum2) - (v + sum1) * (v + sum1)) / ((n1) * (n1)));

        return { n: n1, m: m1, s: s1 };
    }
    ```
